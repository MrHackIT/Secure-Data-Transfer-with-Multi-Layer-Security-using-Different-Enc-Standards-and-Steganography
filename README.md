"**Well, hello there!**"
This repository is meant to provide an example for Secure-Data-Transfer-with-Multi-Layer-Security-using-Different-Enc-Standards-and-Steganography.

This was my first project at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester. The project was successfully completed by Rakesh Puri and Rohan Mode under the Guidance of Professor Sumita Mishra. 

Abstract:
Even with the present technology in cyber security, data protection is still a big challenge. Especially when the data is stored in advanced pictures such as QR codes and barcodes, the information stored in QR codes can easily be read with the help of barcode scanners. The weakness of correspondence of such advanced pictures has become a critical issue these days, specifically when the images are communicated through uncertain channels where the information in the advanced pictures is vulnerable to leak. Picture encryption procedure ought to be planned in a manner that works on the adequacy of correspondence and keeps up with the information safe and secure from an assault of adversaries over the insecure channel. However, encryption only suffices the purpose of confidentiality in this case; If the data in the advanced pictures is altered, the receiver can't validate the integrity of the data.
In this project, we focus on adding multiple layers of security on QR codes to achieve confidentiality and integrity. Multiple layers of security involve a hash watermark and hiding the QR code in a Steganographic image. Further, encrypting the picture with different encryption standards, then transferring the image over the cloud between servers in a more secure way. Symmetric encryption and steganographic methods are the foundation for our approach to multiple layers of security.
